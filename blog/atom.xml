        <![CDATA[<p>Update patch finished for the 4 question arcs.</p><p>An installer has been added for the Mac OSX version with many thanks to Roto, the newest member of our team. <br /></p><p>New features for all versions include a ctrl skip that is much faster (the 's' skip is the same speed that it used to be), and song titles and artist names have been translated/romanized as the case may be.&nbsp; The titles used at the moment are temporary; we hope to ask the artists themselves if they have any preferences and include those in the next update.&nbsp; Also, many of the larger picture files have been converted into png format to save space.<br /></p><p>Though many edits have been made to all parts of Episode 1, chapters 14 and onwards have been sifted through line by line.&nbsp; Total number of lines that have been changed for accuracy or flow is more than 1300...yeah, seriously.<br /></p><p>This version of the patch does <strong>not</strong> include a full set of edits based on new info from EP5.&nbsp; Hopefully, a new version will be released along with the EP5 patch when that is finished.</p><p>&nbsp;You can find the new patches <a href="http://www.witch-hunt.com/stage.html" title="Getting Started">here</a>.<br /></p>]]>
