# witch-hunt
An archive of Witch-Hunt.com, the home of initial fan translations of Umineko no Naku Koro Ni.

I put nothing into this website, the translations therein, etc, just a fan from 2025 trying to see what the origins were like :)

The pages are pulled from archive.org's wayback machine, but fixes are made wherever possible to keep the site's full functionality.
